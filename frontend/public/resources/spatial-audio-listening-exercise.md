1. Close your eyes and listen to the demo
2. Identify the position of each instrument:
   - Front/Back position
   - Left/Right position  
   - Distance perception
3. Draw a simple diagram showing instrument positions

**B. Movement Tracking (5 minutes)**
1. Have a partner move sound sources while you listen
2. Track movement with your finger in the air
3. Note when movement becomes difficult to detect

**C. Distance Assessment (5 minutes)**
1. Listen as instruments are moved closer/farther
2. Describe how distance changes affect:
   - Volume perception
   - Frequency response
   - Clarity/definition

### Reflection Questions
- Which positions were easiest/hardest to identify?
- How does spatial positioning affect your attention to different instruments?
- What happens when multiple sounds occupy similar spatial positions?

## Exercise 2: Musical Context and Spatialization (20 minutes)

### Setup
1. Upload your own music file or use provided samples
2. Position different instruments/elements in the 3D space
3. Experiment with various arrangements

### Tasks
**A. Traditional vs. Spatial Arrangement (8 minutes)**
1. Listen to a piece in standard stereo
2. Re-position elements spatially and compare:
   - Clarity of individual parts
   - Overall musical coherence
   - Emotional impact

**B. Ensemble Simulation (7 minutes)**
1. Create a virtual ensemble arrangement:
   - Place strings in front
   - Position brass behind/to sides
   - Locate percussion at back
2. Listen and adjust for optimal balance
3. Compare to traditional mixing approaches

**C. Creative Exploration (5 minutes)**
1. Experiment with unconventional positioning:
   - Moving sounds during playback
   - Circular arrangements
   - Vertical positioning
2. Note interesting discoveries or effects

### Documentation
Record your observations:
- Most effective arrangements for different musical styles
- Unexpected discoveries about spatial hearing
- Ideas for classroom applications

## Exercise 3: Educational Applications (15 minutes)

### Setup
1. Consider different educational scenarios
2. Use the platform to demonstrate each concept
3. Think from both teacher and student perspectives

### Tasks
**A. Part Learning (5 minutes)**
1. Take a 4-part choral piece or ensemble work
2. Isolate your part by positioning it prominently
3. Gradually introduce other parts spatially
4. Assess how this affects learning efficiency

**B. Harmonic Analysis (5 minutes)**
1. Position chord tones in different spatial locations
2. Listen to harmonic progressions with spatial separation
3. Identify how space aids harmonic understanding
4. Test with complex harmonies (jazz chords, extended harmonies)

**C. Form and Structure (5 minutes)**
1. Use spatial positioning to highlight musical form:
   - Theme in center, variations around periphery
   - Different sections in different spatial areas
   - Transitional materials in specific zones
2. Evaluate effectiveness for teaching musical form

### Teaching Applications Brainstorm
Consider how spatial audio could enhance:
- Ear training exercises
- Ensemble balance training
- Compositional understanding
- Performance preparation
- Music appreciation activities

### Tasks
**A. Acoustic Environments (3 minutes)**
1. Compare the same musical excerpt in different simulated spaces:
   - Concert hall
   - Jazz club  
   - Cathedral
   - Outdoor amphitheater
2. Note how environment affects musical character

**B. Genre-Specific Applications (4 minutes)**
1. Test spatial techniques with different styles:
   - Classical orchestral works
   - Jazz combos
   - Rock/pop productions
   - Electronic music
2. Identify optimal approaches for each genre

**C. Interactive Elements (3 minutes)**
1. Practice real-time spatial manipulation
2. Experiment with automated movement
3. Test responsiveness and control precision
